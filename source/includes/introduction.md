# Introduction

The Cosmic JS REST API helps you easily manage data and files for your applications.  We support cross-origin resource sharing, allowing you to interact securely with our API from a client-side web application (though you should never expose your private keys or credentials in any public website's client-side code). JSON is returned by all API responses, including errors.
